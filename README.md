For specifically one individual to look over.

The goal of the test was to create an animation IO tool for an animated character.
PySide2 had to be used.
(If you want that very same character, let me know)


Add these two files to your script editor:
AnimIO.py
AnimIO_UI.py

Run this code in Maya:
import AnimIO_UI; AnimIO_UI.animCurveIO_UI()
